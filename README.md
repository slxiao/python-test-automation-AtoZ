# Introduction


Test automation is one major application of the Python programming langurage. Inspired by [An A-Z of useful Python tricks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-a-z-of-useful-python-tricks-b467524ee747/) (which however focuses on Python basics), I created this repo to present A-Z useful tricks for Python automated tesing domain.

The tricks is composed by awesome Python testing features, libraries and frameworks. Generally, they can be classified into two parts:

- **Python-specific testing tricks**. For example, python `unittest`, python `coverage`. There tools are used for testing Python programs. In other words, they are dedicetd for Python langurage whilebox testing.
- **General-purpose testing tricks**. Since Python is general-purpose langurage, many test automation tools are written in Python and generally, they can be used in any kind of (blackbox) testing. Such tools include `Robot Framework`, `Selenium`, `pytest` and etc.
